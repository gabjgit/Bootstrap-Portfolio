# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
Using my existing images of works Ceramics and 3D, I've built a portfolio website using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. One of the features of this webpage is a navigation bar which directs the user to each section of the page--- About, Works, Contact and CV. On the 'Work' section, each title can be hovered, revealing a button that allows the user to be redirected to another page. The 'Contact' section also has clickable elements that directs the user to sending an email, to my LinkedIn profile, GitHub and Spotify playlist.
